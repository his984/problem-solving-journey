\### The Logic of Binary to Decimal Conversion



The entire process is based on a single, simple concept: \*\*Place Value\*\*. A digit's value depends on its position within the number.



\#### 1\\. The Concept in our Decimal System (Base-10)



Think about the number \*\*345\*\*. We intuitively understand this as:



&nbsp; - The \*\*5\*\* is in the "ones" place ($10^0$), so its value is $5 \\\\times 1 = 5$.

&nbsp; - The \*\*4\*\* is in the "tens" place ($10^1$), so its value is $4 \\\\times 10 = 40$.

&nbsp; - The \*\*3\*\* is in the "hundreds" place ($10^2$), so its value is $3 \\\\times 100 = 300$.



The final number is the sum of these values: $300 + 40 + 5 = 345$.

The formula is: Sum of `(digit \* 10^position)`.

\### 2\\. Applying the Same Logic to Binary (Base-2) ðŸ§ 



Binary follows the \*\*exact same principle\*\*, but the \*\*base is 2\*\*, not 10.

The place values are powers of 2: `...16, 8, 4, 2, 1` (which are `$2^4, 2^3, 2^2, 2^1, 2^0$`).



\#### Step-by-Step Example: Convert `1101`



\*\*1. Write down the binary number and assign a position (power) to each digit, starting from 0 on the right.\*\*



```

Binary Digit:   1   1   0   1

Position:       3   2   1   0

```



\*\*2. For each digit, calculate `digit \* (2^position)`.\*\*



&nbsp; - Rightmost digit: `1 \* (2^0)` = `1 \* 1` = \*\*1\*\*

&nbsp; - Next digit:      `0 \* (2^1)` = `0 \* 2` = \*\*0\*\*

&nbsp; - Next digit:      `1 \* (2^2)` = `1 \* 4` = \*\*4\*\*

&nbsp; - Leftmost digit:    `1 \* (2^3)` = `1 \* 8` = \*\*8\*\*



\*\*3. Sum the results.\*\*

$$8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 13$$



âœ… \*\*Result\*\*: The binary number `1101` is equal to the decimal number \*\*13\*\*.
